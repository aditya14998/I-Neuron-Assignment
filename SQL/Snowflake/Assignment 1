--- 6.Create a new column called process days and calculate how many days it takes for each order id to process from the order to its shipment.

Alter table sales
Add column process_days varchar(20);

select * from sales;

Update sales
Set process_days = datediff('day',order_date,ship_date);

select process_days from sales;

---5.Create a new column called Rating and then based on the Process dates give rating like given below.
---a. If process days less than or equal to 3days then rating should be 5
---b. If process days are greater than 3 and less than or equal to 6 then rating should be 4
---c. If process days are greater than 6 and less than or equal to 10 then rating should be 3
---d. If process days are greater than 10 then the rating should be 2.

Alter table sales
Add column Rating Varchar(10);

select * from sales;

Update sales
Set Rating= Case 
            When process_days <=3 then 5
            when process_days >3 and process_days <= 6 then 4
            when process_days >6 and process_days <= 10 then 3
            else 2
            End;
